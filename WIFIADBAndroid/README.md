## Get start
* Connect wifi
* Click the middle circle button,and root privileges are required
* When you are successful, you will see a row of ip address with port number
* After that,if you has already installed [this intellij plugin](https://github.com/Sausure/WIFIADB/tree/master/WIFIADBIntelliJPlugin),you should just paste this row of number to the plugin and then you can manage you devices on it;or you just enter a command like "adb connect \<port address\>" to connect your devices through your terminal
