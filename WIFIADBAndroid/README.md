## There are just a few steps.
* Turn on the wifi
* Click the middle circle button,and root privileges are required
* When you are successful, you will see a port address
* After that,if you has already installed [my intellij plugin](https://github.com/Sausure/WIFIADB/tree/master/WIFIADBIntelliJPlugin),you should just paste the port address to the plugin and manage you devices by it;or you just use a command like "adb connect \<port address\>" to connect your devices from terminal
